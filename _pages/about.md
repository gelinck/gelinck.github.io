Graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Physics from CPES (PSL University) in 2021, and with an engineering degree with a major in Fundamental and Applied Mathematics from École Polytechnique (IPP) in 2025, I am now preparing my PhD in Mathematics at CERMICS (ENPC).

My main research interests are PDEs, spectral theory, and control theory. During my PhD, I am working on stabilization problems for hyperbolic systems, in particular the F-equivalence problem and the output-feedback stabilization problem.
